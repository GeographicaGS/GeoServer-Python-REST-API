GeoServer Python REST API
=========================

This is the documentation for the GeoServer Python REST API. This is a
commodity project aimed at scripting GeoServer's deployment as much as
possible. It is not intended to create a complete Python wrapper for
the GeoServer API, but to create some functionality to do automated
system administration tasks in an array of GeoServers.
