Objectives
==========

This is an ongoing project for creating a Python REST API module for interacting with GeoServer. It is by no means complete, it's just a tool for automating certain admin tasks here at Geographica, like for example harvesting info about layers and its databases of origin. There is no intention to create a full-fledged module with all the functionality provided by the API, just what we are needing on the fly.

Changelog
=========

Version 0.1:

- Basic information reading for a GeoServer instances, layers, workspaces, data stores, and feature types, just for basic harvesting and cataloging, with a special emphasis on PostGIS data stores with the aim to trace back the origin of data sources from layers to database.

TODO
====

- Document current version (v0.1).

- Make the API more coherent between objects, revise terminology.
